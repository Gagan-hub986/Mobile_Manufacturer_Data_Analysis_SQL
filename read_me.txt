Project Name: Mobile Manufacturer Data Analysis

Description : 

A SQL-based Data Analysis Project
This project involved performing advanced SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and manufacturer performance in the mobile phone industry. Key aspects included:

State-based customer analysis: Identified the states where customers bought cellphones over a defined period.
Samsung sales tracking: Analyzed which state had the highest sales of Samsung mobile phones.
Sales transactions analysis: Calculated transaction data by model and region, providing insights into market distribution.
Product pricing insights: Determined the cheapest cellphones and analyzed the average price for models in the top five manufacturers.
Customer spend analysis: Identified customers with high spending patterns in 2009 and analyzed their average spend.
Sales trend analysis: Examined sales consistency of models across multiple years and identified manufacturers' top sales.
Missing year analysis: Discovered manufacturers that sold cellphones in specific years but did not in others.
Top customer insights: Analyzed top customers' spending and identified the percentage change in their purchase behavior.

Technologies Used:   In this project i used SSMS (SQL server managment studio) of MS-SQL Mainly and additionally tools that helps me to complete this project is by Microsoft Excel in which some advance Formula is require to clean the data first and after i import this data into SQL server

Instruction : i attached two files of sql first is by name of (Gagan_Mobile_Mnaufacturer) in which all my queries are there and other is (SQL Case Study 2 (Create Database and Tables)) in whhich i already mentioned the data just open it and run 
Step:1 Download both the sql file (Gagan_Mobile_Mnaufacturer and SQL Case Study 2 (Create Database and Tables))
Step:2 Open Sql Server and open the SQL Case Study 2 (Create Database and Tables) File first And run All the Queries in one go 
Step:3 Set To db_sql database first and then Open the second file by name of Gagan_Mobile_Mnaufacturer.sql
Step:4 Run the query to see the output

Conculusion : The Mobile Manufacturer Data Analysis case study provided key insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance. By analyzing data, it highlighted high-performing models, identified areas for market expansion, and improved decision-making through data-driven strategies, ultimately boosting overall operational efficiency and competitive advantage.
